# QUIC.cloud
{: .fs-9 }

QUIC.cloud is a WordPress Acceleration Platform, the first and only complete WordPress optimization solution.
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

---

## Prerequisites
- A [WordPress](https://wordpress.com/) site
- A [LiteSpeed Cache for WordPress plugin](https://litespeedtech.com/products/cache-plugins/wordpress-acceleration)

## Getting Started
Pairing WordPress and QUIC.cloud is required, but creating a QUIC.cloud account is not.

You only need to create a QUIC.cloud account if you plan to use the CDN. Otherwise, an account is optional.

There are benefits to a QUIC.cloud account, including a handy dashboard where you can:

*   See detailed usage, statistics & even errors for all services
*   Have the ability to increase the quota limits with credits
*   Set up & manage all QUIC.cloud CDN options
*   Easily open a QUIC.cloud support ticket
*   Manage multiple domains in one place

For detailed instructions on _pairing_ your WordPress site with QUIC.cloud, please see [Pairing WordPress and QUIC.cloud](/quic-cloud-doc/pairing).

Once you have paired WordPress with QUIC.cloud, you can begin using [Image Optimization](https://quic.cloud/quic-cloud-services-and-features/image-optimization-service), [Page Optimization](https://quic.cloud/quic-cloud-services-and-features/critical-css-service) and other cloud services immediately.
