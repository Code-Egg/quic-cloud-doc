## Pair WordPress and QUIC.cloud



In order to use QUIC.cloud, you must pair it with the LiteSpeed Cache for Wordpress plugin in your WordPress admin. Here's how.

Initiate in WordPress
---------------------

![Request Domain Key](https://quic.cloud/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/General-Settings.png)

Sign into the WordPress dashboard for the domain you’d like to use with QUIC.cloud. Navigate to **LiteSpeed Cache > General**, and click the **Request Domain Key** button, on the right side of the **Domain Key** box.

![Approved Domain Key](https://quic.cloud/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Approved-Domain-Key.png)

You will see a notification at the top of the page, indicating that the application was successful. Wait a few minutes and then refresh the page. The **Domain Key** setting will have been automatically updated with the new key.

The next step is to create a QUIC.cloud account. However, you only need to do so if you plan to use the CDN. An account is optional, if you only plan to use the QUIC.cloud WordPress services.

There are benefits to a QUIC.cloud account, though, including a handy dashboard where you can:

*   See detailed usage, statistics & even errors for all services
*   Have the ability to increase the quota limits with credits
*   Set up & manage all QUIC.cloud CDN options
*   Easily open a QUIC.cloud support ticket
*   Manage multiple domains in one place

To register your QUIC.cloud account, click the **Link to QUIC.cloud** button.

**NOTE**: if you choose not to set up a QUIC.cloud account, then you are finished and you may begin using Image Optimization, Page Optimization, and other QUIC.cloud non-CDN services immediately.
