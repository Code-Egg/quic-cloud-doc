## Pair WordPress and QUIC.cloud

In order to use QUIC.cloud, you must pair it with the LiteSpeed Cache for Wordpress plugin in your WordPress admin. Here's how.

Initiate in WordPress
---------------------

![Request Domain Key](https://quic.cloud/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/General-Settings.png)

Sign into the WordPress dashboard for the domain you’d like to use with QUIC.cloud. Navigate to **LiteSpeed Cache > General**, and click the **Request Domain Key** button, on the right side of the **Domain Key** box.

![Approved Domain Key](https://quic.cloud/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Approved-Domain-Key.png)

You will see a notification at the top of the page, indicating that the application was successful. Wait a few minutes and then refresh the page. The **Domain Key** setting will have been automatically updated with the new key.

If you choose not to set up a QUIC.cloud account, then you are finished and you may begin using Image Optimization, Page Optimization, and other QUIC.cloud non-CDN services immediately.
