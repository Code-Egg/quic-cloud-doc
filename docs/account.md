## Sign up for QUIC.cloud
----------------------

You will be redirected to QUIC.cloud to sign up.

**NOTE**: If you already have a QUIC.cloud account for another domain, there is no need to create a new account. You can have multiple domains in your QUIC.cloud account. Simply sign into your existing account. This domain will be added, the connection will be complete, and you will be redirected back to your WordPress dashboard. Skip the next section, and go directly to **Verify Connection in WordPress**.  

## Set up QUIC.cloud
-----------------

Choose a password, agree to the QUIC.cloud terms and conditions, and click **Register**.

Check your email for a validation message from QUIC.cloud, and confirm your account by clicking the activation link within.

Your QUIC.cloud-WordPress connection is complete!

Verify Connection in WordPress
------------------------------

Back in WordPress, you will know the connection was successful when you see the **Visit my Dashboard on QUIC.cloud** button on the **LiteSpeed Cache > General** page.
